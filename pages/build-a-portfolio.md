# Build a Portfolio

## Why should you build a portfolio?

Having a portfolio when applying for an internship, co-op, or job can make a huge difference. In fact, it could be the difference between getting the position or not. Keep in mind that you want to stand out from other candidates, and having a great portfolio is an easy way to distinguish yourself. It is something everyone can create when taken the time and putting in some effort.

## How should you build a portfolio?

In the Applied Computer Science program every student has access to a jail where a portfolio can be hosted. If you do not have access to a jail yet, please reach out to one of your professors. In almost every course you work on artifacts, such as assignments and projects, that can become part of your portfolio. Obviously, you will also need to construct a website which is a good exercise in and of itself. It is probably also a good idea to include an up-to-date resume.

## Tips

* Make sure the design looks clean.
* You want to update your portfolio and homepage after every semester.
* Projects can be especially impressive, so make sure to include these on your homepage.
* For inspiration, you can check out other [jails](jails) but note that many are a work in progress although there are always some really nice ones.
