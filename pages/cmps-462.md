# CMPS 462 Data Mining

[All Courses](courses)

## Course Description

A follow up course on CMPS 163 that is much more technical. In addition to a mathematical understanding of algorithms this course also lets students implement their own algorithms. Prerequisites: CMPS 163, CMPS 261, and CMPS 262. 3 credits.

## Course Objectives

Upon successful completion of the course, students should be able to:
1) Describe the data mining process in detail.
2) Explain the mathematical underpinnings of data mining algorithms.
(3) Implement data mining algorithms.
(4) Solve a problem by using data mining algorithms and providing a user interface.
