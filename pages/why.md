# Why Applied Computer Science

## A Changing Society

It becomes increasingly harder to imagine any human activity that does not use software or data. More software and data drives more automation, many examples of which are discussed in [this Humans Need Not Apply YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU). When picking a career now, it is important to consider what might happen in the next few decades (e.g., is the job at risk of automation?). A safe bet would be picking a career and program that focuses on driving automation, which is what the [Applied Computer Science program](https://www.pointpark.edu/academics/schools/business/undergraduateprogram/appliedcomputerscience) at [Point Park University](https://www.pointpark.edu/) provides. It also provides a means to have a huge impact on society, just look at how pervasive sofware and data is throughout many industries. In addition, many of the current big tech companies started as small startup that grew to companies that impact billions of people and started out by just a few people that know how to program.

## A Varied Field and Program

Even in the first year in the Applied Computer Science program (formerly IT) you will encounter the following courses:

- [CMPS 160 Databases](cmps-160): virtually all data is stored in databases, so it is important to have a solid foundation in SQL.
- [CMPS 161 Networking and Security](cmps-161): knowing how the internet works and be safe online is a critical skill.
- [CMPS 162 Introduction to Programming](cmps-162): programming and software development can almost be considered a superpower.
- [CMPS 163 Business Analytics](cmps-163): using data to make more informed decision is a critical skill in the 21st century.

Each of these fields provides many career opportunities, see also the Job Prospects below. We have concentrations for the most popular areas:

- Software Development.
- Big Data & Analytics.
- Networking and Security.

See also the [degree requirements](degree-requirements) for more information.

## Job Prospects

The Bureau of Labor Statistics has a [great overview of opportunities in the field](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/home.htm). Almost all areas will grow rapidly in the next decades. The numbers speak for themselves.
