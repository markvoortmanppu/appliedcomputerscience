# CMPS 262 Advanced Programming

[All Courses](courses)

## Course Description

This course continues where CMPS 162 and CMPS 260 leave off. The focus will be on problem solving but with a much higher difficulty level. The students will be required to write programs that involve multiple units of organization, e.g., classes. Several advanced algorithms will be discussed and should be implemented by the students. Prerequisites: CMPS 260 3 credits.

## Course Objectives

Upon successful completion of the course, students should be able to:
(1) Apply all knowledge from CMPS 162 and CMPS 260 to solve real problems.
2) Decompose complex problems to find solutions.
(3) Construct complex user interfaces for running algorithms that solve problems.
(4) Collaborate in a group setting.
(5) Present project results and updates to stakeholders.
