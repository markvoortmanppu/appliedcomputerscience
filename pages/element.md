## Why Element

* See [Introducing Element](introducing-element) for details.

## Installing Element

* Go to [app.element.io](https://app.element.io/) and create an account.
* Your account name can be anything but make sure you can keep it long term.
* For example, I used `markvoortman` as username.
* It is advisable to also provide a personal email address (do not use your Point Park one as it may expire).
* **IMPORTANT:** After signing up make sure you back up your keys:
  * Click on your name at the left top.
  * Open Security & Privacy.
  * Set up Key Backup under Encryption.
  * Make sure to store the provided information carefully!
* Send a message to `@markvoortman:matrix.org` (please identify yourself) and you will be added to the Point Park University Space.
  * Please also include which course section you are in and what your major is.
* Add yourself to the rooms available in the Space that you would like to follow.
* Usually you will also be invited to a room dedicated to the course.
* Ideally, you should install the app on your phone right away as well while you still have the browser session open, so that you have a second session cross-signed/validated (this way you are less likely to lose data due to losing keys and the E2E encryption).
* **Do not log out of the browser session unless you backup your keys and/or log into another session or some messages may be lost.**

## Using the Apps

* Make sure you have the session from [app.element.io](https://app.element.io/) open in your browser.
* Install the Element app from the App/Play Store or install one of the Desktop apps.
* It will ask you to cross-sign/validate your new login, which is why you need the other session.

## Tips
