## Why Element

* See [Introducing Element](introducing-element) for details.

## Installing Element

* Go to [app.element.io](https://app.element.io/) and create an account.
* Your account name can be anything but make sure you can keep it long term.
* For example, I used `markvoortman` as username.
* It is advisable to also provide a personal email address (do not use your Point Park one as it may expire).
* **IMPORTANT:** After signing up make sure you back up your keys:
  * Click on your name at the left top.
  * Open Security & Privacy.
  * Set up Key Backup under Encryption.
  * Make sure to store the provided information carefully!
* Send a message to `@markvoortman:matrix.org` (please identify yourself) and you will be added to the Point Park University community.
* Add yourself to the rooms you would like to follow.
* You can revisit the community by hovering over the P at the left top, clicking on the 3 dots, and go to View Community.
* Ideally, you should install the app on your phone right away as well while you still have the browser session open.

## Using the Apps

* Make sure you have the session from [app.element.io](https://app.element.io/) open in your browser.
* Install the Element app from the App/Play Store.
* It will ask you to cross-sign/validate your new login, which is why you need the other session.
