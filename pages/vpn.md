# VPN

Starting Fall 2025, you have to use the VPN to connect to your jail. Please follow these steps to achieve this:

- Make sure you are eligible to connect; currently only CMPS 480 students will be able to (more to follow soon).
- Download the Cisco AnyConnect client from [here](https://vpn.pointpark.edu/) and **make sure to select the Point Park VPN – CMPS group to authenticate there**.
- Install the Cisco AnyConnect client after downloading.
- Run the Cisco AnyConnect client after installing and connect to **vpn.pointpark.edu** and select the **Point Park VPN – CMPS** group again.
- If you do not have a jail yet, please [contact](contact) your instructor.
- Once connected to the VPN, you can use the Terminal, PuTTY, FileZilla, the MySQL Workbench, etc., to connect to your jail in the normal way (make sure to use your jail credentials).
- After the previous steps you can follow any other [tutorial](tutorials) on this site and it should work.
- [Contact](contact) your instructor if you run into problems.
