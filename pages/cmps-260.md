# CMPS 260 Data Structures

[All Courses](courses)

## Course Description

In this course fundamental data structures will be explored that are indispensable when programming. Some major areas are objects, lists, arrays, stacks, queues, and more. Tradeoffs in terms of computational complexity and operations on these data structures are also discussed. Prerequisites: CMPS 162. 3 credits.

## Course Objectives

Upon successful completion of the course, students should be able to:
(1) Describe what kinds of data structures exist.
(2) Identify when these data structures are applicable.
(3) Compare data structures.
(4) Perform operations on these data structures.
(5) Have some familiarity with the computational complexity tradeoffs.
(6) Model basic data structures with a programming language.
