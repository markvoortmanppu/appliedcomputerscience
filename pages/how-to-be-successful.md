# How to be Successful

There are some fairly simple steps one can follow to maximize the likelihood of being successful, but these steps are often not easy. This page provides an overview of these steps and what habits can be developed to follow these steps. Successful in this context refers to being successfull professionally, although many of these recommendations should also benefit other parts of your life.

If you are unable to read all the advice below, please make sure you at least read the advice in the last section (Build Positive Habits).

## Sleep

A lack of sleep will impair cognitive abilties, which can be especially challenging when working on challinging tasks like programming. In addition, there is also evidence that sleep deprivation is linked to numerous fatal diseases, including dementia. Not sleeping enough can also have a negative effect on the amount of exercise and eating habits. With some rare exceptions, most adults need between 7 and 8 hours of sleep each night. Some simple strategies to make sure you sleep enough is following a fixed sleeping schedule, avoid eating, exercising, and blue light a few hours before going to sleep, and being active and getting some sunlight early in the day. Sleeping pills and alcohol have a negative effect on the quality of sleep.

## Exercise

There is a lot of scientific evidence that shows that exercise has numerous health benefits, even if it is just going for a walk several times a week. Exercising will helps with disease prevention, such as for cardiovascular diseases, and also has a positive effect on brain function and cognition and can reduce stress. It may be best to exercise outdoors in nature, if possible. For more information please see [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise).

## Diet

Diet is another factor that can have a significant impact on your health and well-being. There is a lot of evidence that simply avoiding processed foods and sugar can have a significant positive impact on your overall health. Of course, staying away from smoking and alcohol is beneficial as well as these act as carcinogens. Eating more fruits and vegetables is almost always a good idea. In some cases eating less or even (intermittent) fasting can also have health benefits. For more information please see [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthy_diet).

## No Multitasking

The human brain is not capable of performing two similar tasks at the same time, i.e., [multitasking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_multitasking). It can alternate between the two, known as context switching, but this is expensive and takes time and will also introduce unnecessary errors. This is simple to understand but very hard to do in today's world with an abundance of distractions. At the same time, being able to focus when working on difficult problems like programming and data science is becoming increasingly valuable. One resource that might help is the book [Deep Work by Cal Newport](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted-ebook/dp/B00X47ZVXM/), which also has concrete advise on maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

## Be On Time

One thing that is simple and also fairly easy to implement is being on time. It always makes a bad impression when someone is late. Depending on the occassion, you may want to make sure you have a buffer just in case. For example, if you are just meeting with a friend then you don't need a big buffer because while being a few minutes late does not give a good impression, the consequences are minor. On the other hand, if you are going to a job interview you want to make sure you are on time even if you run into some minor trouble, such as bad traffic. So try to be early and just wait in your car before going in for the interview. You may lose a potential job just because you left the house late.

## Leave a Favorably Impression

In line with the previous section, make sure to always leave a favorable impression as you never know how it may benefit you. There are some simple things you can do. Always be prepared, such as when attending a meeting. Try to smile and be positive, when possible. Turn on your camera when attending online meetings. Ask questions to show interest and test your understanding. If it is unclear you have to do something, do it anyway unless asking makes more sense. And so on.

## Use a System to Keep Track of Things

Nowadays there are a lot of tools available that make it easy to track things. We all have our smartphones with us at all times and it has calendaring functionality. If you are forgetting meetings or homework you need to work on a better system. Ideally, every day when you wake up it should be clear what things you have to do and complete that day.

## Be Intellectually Curious

The best way to acquire skills and knowledge is to be intellectually curious about the world. Just look at how children approach the world and how quickly they learn. One of the most important facets is to always question things and then do some research to answer these questions. Make sure you utilize a variety of sources, ideally some of which are scientifically sound.

## Read Books

One of the best ways to be intellectually curious is to read books, because some books are incredibly insightful and stood the test of time. Reading comprehension is also an important skill to develop. Throughout this page you can find references to books that should be very worthwhile to read and there are many others out there.

## Address Challenges with a Growth Mindset

The growth mindset is the believe that talent and skill is not fixed at birth but can be developed over time. People that believe in a fixed mindset, the opposite of a growth mindset, tend to give up earlier because they don't believe they can improve and if they fail it is just because they are not smart enough. This is somewhat of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Nowadays there is a lot of evidence that growth is possible in many areas, as is evidence by the plasticity of the brain, although there are of course some limitations. To learn more about this check out  [Mindset by Carol Dweck](https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Carol-S-Dweck-ebook/dp/B000FCKPHG/) and [Grit by Angela Duckworth](https://www.amazon.com/Grit-Passion-Perseverance-Angela-Duckworth-ebook/dp/B010MH9V3W/).

## Keep a Small and Positive Identity

An identity is how we view ourselves. If we believe that we have a fixed mindset it becomes part of our identity and we behave that way, i.e., we may not try new things. Therefore, it is important to develop an identity that is small and positive. If you tell yourself repeatedly that you are a hard work, and you also turn this into action, then over time hard work is something that you value and makes it possible for you to achieve your goals. The main point is that you should be very careful what you tell yourself because you will start believing it.

## Introspection and Mindfulness

An important meta-skill to develop is introspection. This simply means looking at your own behavior and state of mind and trying to explain why you behaved a certain way or why you feel a certain way. For example, do you feel stressed now? If yes, why? Is it because you started working on the homework too late? Is that something you can change in the future. And so on. Mindfulness is a way to be more in the moment and observe oneself. Many positive benefits have been documented.

## Build Positive Habits

Most of our behavior, good or bad, is shaped by habits. A habit is a routine of behavior that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously. To implement any of the advise above you need to turn it into sustainable habits. You will have a hard time exercising regularly if you don't turn it into a process that is easily repeatable and nearly impossible to forget. For example, you could decide to go for a run after work every day but you still need to make sure you actually do this every day. Several things may help.

First of all, you have to make sure you bring running gear and to do that consistently you can set a reminder. You may also not want to start out running 5 times a week as it is too hard to maintain, but just start with every Monday. Other things that may help is the knowledge that you will be spending your time a lot better than standing in traffic that barely moves due to rush hour. You can also track your weight if that is a consideration and you might remember that you feel great after running. Another thing you can do is to sign up for a race just to give you another incentive to start working out. The main point is that developing habits does not happen overnight and you have to be careful in how you approach it.

Habits tend to consist of a cue, a routine, and a reward. In the above example, the cue is the end of the work day, the routine is going for a run, and the reward is feeling good after completing the run. It is also possible to do "habit stacking", where you use an existing habit to lead into another, new habit. This can be a very powerful tactic and allows you to create a chain of effective habits. Another thing worth mentioning is that bad habits cannot really be unlearned, but they can be replaced by better habits.
