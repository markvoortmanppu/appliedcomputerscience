## Sleep

A lack of sleep will impair cognitive abilties, which can be especially challenging when working on challinging tasks like programming. In addition, there is also evidence that sleep deprivation is linked to numerous fatal diseases, including dementia. Not sleeping enough can also have a negative effect on the amount of exercise and eating habits. With some rare exceptions, most adults need between 7 and 8 hours of sleep each night. Some simple strategies to make sure you sleep enough is following a fixed sleeping schedule, avoid eating, exercising, and blue light a few hours before going to sleep, and being active and getting some sunlight early in the day. Sleeping pills and alcohol have a negative effect on the quality of sleep.
