# How to be Successful

There are some fairly simple steps one can follow to maximize the likelihood of being successful, but these steps are often not easy. This page provides an overview of these steps and what habits can be developed to follow these steps. Successful in this context refers to being successfull professionally, although many of these recommendations should also benefit other parts of your life.

If you are unable to read all the advice below, please make sure you at least read the advice in the last section (Build Positive Habits).

## Sleep

A lack of sleep will impair cognitive abilties, which can be especially challenging when working on challinging tasks like programming. In addition, there is also evidence that sleep deprivation is linked to numerous fatal diseases, including dementia. Not sleeping enough can also have a negative effect on the amount of exercise and eating habits. With some rare exceptions, most adults need between 7 and 8 hours of sleep each night. Some simple strategies to make sure you sleep enough is following a fixed sleeping schedule, avoid eating, exercising, and blue light a few hours before going to sleep, and being active and getting some sunlight early in the day. Sleeping pills and alcohol have a negative effect on the quality of sleep.

## Exercise

There is a lot of scientific evidence that shows that exercise has numerous health benefits, even if it is just going for a walk several times a week. Exercising will helps with disease prevention, such as for cardiovascular diseases, and also has a positive effect on brain function and cognition and can reduce stress. It may be best to exercise outdoors in nature, if possible. For more information please see [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise).

## Diet

Diet is another factor that can have a significant impact on your health and well-being. There is a lot of evidence that simply avoiding processed foods and sugar can have a significant positive impact on your overall health. Of course, staying away from smoking and alcohol is beneficial as well as these act as carcinogens. Eating more fruits and vegetables is almost always a good idea. In some cases eating less or even (intermittent) fasting can also have health benefits. For more information please see [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthy_diet).

## No Multitasking

The human brain is not capable of performing two similar tasks at the same time, i.e., [multitasking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_multitasking). It can alternate between the two, known as context switching, but this is expensive and takes time and will also introduce unnecessary errors. This is simple to understand but very hard to do in today's world with an abundance of distractions. At the same time, being able to focus when working on difficult problems like programming and data science is becoming increasingly valuable. One resource that might help is the book [Deep Work by Cal Newport](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted-ebook/dp/B00X47ZVXM/), which also has concrete advise on maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

## Build Positive Habits

Most of our behavior, good or bad, is shaped by habits. A habit is a routine of behavior that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously. To implement any of the advise above you need to turn it into sustainable habits. You will have a hard time exercising regularly if you don't turn it into a process that is easily repeatable and nearly impossible to forget. For example, you could decide to go for a run after work every day but you still need to make sure you actually do this every day. Several things may help.

First of all, you have to make sure you bring running gear and to do that consistently you can set a reminder. You may also not want to start out running 5 times a week as it is too hard to maintain, but just start with every Monday. Other things that may help is the knowledge that you will be spending your time a lot better than standing in traffic that barely moves due to rush hour. You can also track your weight if that is a consideration and you might remember that you feel great after running. Another thing you can do is to sign up for a race just to give you another incentive to start working out. The main point is that developing habits does not happen overnight and you have to be careful in how you approach it.

Habits tend to consist of a cue, a routine, and a reward. In the above example, the cue is the end of the work day, the routine is going for a run, and the reward is feeling good after completing the run. It is also possible to do "habit stacking", where you use an existing habit to lead into another, new habit. This can be a very powerful tactic and allows you to create a chain of effective habits. Another thing worth mentioning is that bad habits cannot really be unlearned, but they can be replaced by better habits.
