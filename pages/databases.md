# Databases

Please find a variety of videos about databases below and make sure to read the notes.

## Getting Started

**NOTE: You now need to connect through the jump box instead of directly from your laptop, see [here](jump-box) for details.**

[Click here](videos/cmps-160-getting-started.mp4) to watch the video:

* Download the MySQL Workbench from here: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/. Make sure that you download just the Workbench installer and not the MySQL installer (sometimes shown under recommended downloads), which contains other software besides the Workbench as well that you do not need and will only be confusing.
* Install the MySQL Workbench.
* Create a new connection by clicking on the little plus at the top right next to MySQL Connections.
* Use the credentials provided to you by your professor.
* The example in the video may be adjusted to your particular situation.

* One additional step is needed around second 20 in the video below. You have to right click on mydb, select Edit Schema, and then change the Schema Name to your Point Park username.
* In your designs you can stick to the relationships that use the dashed lines.

## Forward Engineering

[Click here](videos/forward-engineer.mp4) to watch the video:

* Instead of the `mydb` database you will use the database that carries the same name as your username.
* When you update your design and want to recreate your database **do not forget to delete your tables first**.
